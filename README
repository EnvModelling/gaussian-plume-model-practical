Running code:
    * MATLAB: type >>gaussian_plume_model at the command prompt
    * To do the overlay plot in the MATLAB version type >>overlay_on_map after running 
      the model
    * Python: can be run from ipython, by typing run -i gaussian_plume_model.py 
    * To do the overlay plot in the python version type run -i overlay_on_map.py after 
	  running the model
Contributing development:
	* at the moment the code is under public repo. Contact
